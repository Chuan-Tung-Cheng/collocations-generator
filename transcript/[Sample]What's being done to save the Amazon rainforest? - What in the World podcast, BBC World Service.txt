It is really hard to wrap your head
around just how big it is.
So I looked it up.
6000000km², doesn't mean anything
to me - three Mexicos, that is
a massive amount of forest and home
to so many beautiful species
of animals.
What I wish people knew about the
Amazon is how important it is for all
of us, regardless of where we are.
Hello, it's Hannah here, and welcome
to What in the World, your podcast
for the stories that get people
talking from the BBC World Service.
When you picture the Amazon,
you probably think
of this - rich biodiversity,
billions of trees, creatures you
can't find anywhere else on Earth.
But some parts of it are a bit more
like this.
And this year's big climate summit,
Cop30 is taking place in Belém,
in part of the Amazon in Brazil, and
it has put the global spotlight back
on the world's largest rainforest.
So we have teamed up
with The Climate Question,
the BBC's go to podcast
for everything climate related,
to understand
how important the Amazon is
to our planet
and what's being done to save it.
And here with me
in the studio is Graihagh Jackson,
who hosts the Climate Question.
Hey welcome back.
Thanks so much for having me.
So can you give our listeners an idea
of just how big the Amazon is?
You say it's the largest
tropical rainforest in the world,
it is really hard to wrap your head
around just how big it is.
So I looked it up.
6000000km², doesn't mean anything
to me - three Mexicos,
that does mean something to me.
That is a massive amount of forest
and a massive amount of trees,
and home to so many beautiful species
of animals,
but it's also home to so many people,
and I really had no idea
until I started looking into this.
I've got here
47 million people live in the Amazon,
of which two million are indigenous.
So it's hugely important
for people that live there,
but also for the world,
as I'm sure we're getting into.
When we talk about the Amazon,
we often really focus on Brazil.
And the reason for that is
because around 59/60%
of the Amazon is in Brazil.
So what they do really matters
for the Amazon as a whole.
And I read that the Amazon has
390 billion trees.
Yeah, I always like to picture
the poor person who has to go out
and count all those trees.
I mean, they don't do that. They
take it, obviously, take a data set,
they work out how many
and then they extract by satellite.
But it is mind boggling
how many trees there are there.
I feel really lucky
to have visited part of the Amazon.
It was in Peru and while I was there we
saw these amazing pink river dolphins.
They were kind of mottled grey pink
and apparently they get pinker
as they get older.
The Amazon is so important
for biodiversity.
It's the most biodiverse place
on Earth, and we've been hearing
from someone who is passionate
about the Amazon Dr Erika Berenguer,
who's a senior researcher at Oxford
University and who's also from Brazil.
The most striking thing
about the Amazon,
when you are there, it's how all
your senses get really overwhelmed.
Of course, your eyes, because
the amount of life that is there,
there's always insects buzzing around,
birds crossing your paths, and so,
so, so many trees of different shades of
green that keep glinting under the sun.
Just in terms of species of trees.
We still don't know
how many there are.
Estimates are that across the whole
Amazon basin, which occupies
nine different countries, there are
about 16000 species of trees
and just 11000 has been described
by scientists like myself.
And in the middle of
all these unknowns, there might be,
for example, some plants that might
be useful for different reasons.
They might be useful for medicine,
cosmetics.
What I wish people knew about the Amazon
is how important it is for all of us,
regardless of where we are.
The Amazon generates so much rainfall
that it irrigates fields even in Texas,
or as south as the La Plata Basin
in Argentina and Uruguay.
The Amazon store so much carbon
in its trees
that if it was to be
completely deforested and then burnt,
all the carbon would go
to the atmosphere as CO2 and
would be equivalent to 15 to 20 years
of global greenhouse gas emissions
- certainly make us fail to keep us
below the 1.5 degree of temperature
increase since industrial times.
Graihagh, as well
as the amazing biodiversity
that we have just heard about,
why else is the Amazon important?
It's important for everybody.
I'll talk about the region first though,
because it's really interesting.
So the Amazon - well, you've been,
what does it feel like when you walk
around. What's the climate like?
It's sticky.
It's wet, it's humid and it's hot.
So what's happening?
The sun's shining down and that's
causing all the water to evaporate
and then also evapotranspiration
if it's coming from the leaves.
Yes, I think I was evaporating too.
And that goes all up into the sky.
And you can think of it as like flying
rivers going all across the continent,
which then come down as rain
elsewhere as far as Argentina.
And that's really important
for agriculture, I think crops,
but also places like Brazil are really
highly reliant on hydropower, right?
And you've got to have that rain
in order to have that hydropower.
So it's really important for the
local weather, the region's weather.
But globally it's so important.
And that's because it puts the brakes
on climate change. Now why is that?
So climate change - we talk about this
key planet warming gas, carbon dioxide.
It's released
when we drive our petrol cars
or when we burn coal
to heat our homes or gas, whatever.
Those are all key drivers
of climate change.
Now, what trees do is they absorb
that carbon dioxide.
They suck it all in to put it
in a very basic way
and they use it to create energy.
And it gets stored in the branches
and the leaves in the soil.
And that means that CO2 is no longer
in our atmosphere,
acting as a blanket and trapping
all that heat, so effectively
without nature,
without places like the Amazon,
we would be experiencing
a much hotter world as a result.
The Amazon also has lots
of really valuable resources, right?
Yeah. So many.
I really had no idea.
I mean, I'd heard about the gold,
obviously timber,
given the number of trees there,
but there's also rubber
and coffee and loads of medicine.
So for instance, quinine comes
from the bark of a tree and quinine
was used to treat people for malaria
for like 300 years before
synthetic versions were created.
So there's lots of things there.
Fishing is also really important there.
Diamonds. I'm just looking to see
if you're wearing any diamonds.
You are. Were they from the Amazon,
who knows?
But the other - that's sort of like
the interesting thing about the Amazon,
it's so important for us globally
and that it helps prevent
or puts the brakes on climate change
and affects our weather.
But it's also a huge source
of income. And
lots of people indeed want to develop
the Amazon for exactly that reason.
I mentioned several million people
are living in the Amazon,
and they see it
as a source of income,
a way to develop
and be lifted out of poverty.
Scientists are now warning
that the Amazon is actually
at risk of disappearing.
Yeah, so there are a number
of different reasons for that.
So the number one biggest driver
of tropical deforestation
in the world is cattle ranching.
So that's beef products.
It's our beef burgers but it's also
leather for our shoes, right?
So that's a huge driver of tropical
deforestation around the world.
And I don't think -
it often gets overlooked quite often,
so I think that's really important.
There's also a lot of illegal activity,
especially in the Amazon going on.
So illegal mining, illegal logging,
it's pretty hard to enforce any sort
of protections because it's so wild,
big and remote.
But double whammy is because climate
change is increasing temperatures
and reducing rainfall as well in the
Amazon, you've got a double effect.
So deforestation is causing that.
And climate change
on top of that is causing that.
And what that means is, you know, you've
said you've been in the rainforest.
You will remember that the floor
is covered in leaf litter, right?
Lots of leaves.
And that is typically very wet.
But now the Amazon is drier,
it acts like tinder.
And that means fire can spread so
quickly and so easily in the Amazon
in a way that it hasn't been able to.
So I was looking at some data
between 2001 and 2023,
and fires in the Amazon region are
now burning at least twice as much
as they were in the early noughties.
Last year was a particularly bad
year, a record breaking year in 2024.
So we've heard
how important the Amazon is for all
of these different reasons and
that it's at risk.
What's being done to try
to protect it?
So back in 2021,
there was a global agreement.
More than 100 world leaders signed up
to end deforestation by 2030.
And there were several countries in the
Amazon that signed up to that pledge.
So Peru, Brazil,
Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname,
they all pledged, signed that pledge.
But there are a few countries
I didn't mention there
that do have parts of the Amazon in.
And so Colombia, Bolivia,
French Guiana, Venezuela,
those countries did not sign up
to it. And I was looking as to why.
And Venezuela and Bolivia have both said
that they want to develop the forest.
And this is
a really sort of big contention.
We see a lot of people living in the
Amazon live below the poverty line,
right? They want to develop, they want
to have access to good healthcare.
And a way to make money is
to chop down the trees and sell it.
So there is this really difficult line
to tread between protecting the forest,
but also protecting
the people that live within it.
To reduce the forest fires
that we talked about earlier,
that's a really big global issue,
because that means we have
to get a handle on our emissions.
The only way to stop those forest
fires is not only to stop emitting,
but it's also
to take some carbon dioxide out
of the sky to create a cooler planet.
And the sort of argument there is over
who pays for that, who does that, right?
And historically,
it's been the rich Western countries
that have done most
of the carbon polluting.
And the argument goes from countries
like Brazil 'well, you need to pay.
You need to pay us to protect
this vital resource, the Amazon.
But you also need to pay us damages
that have been caused as a result'.
And so that's why
in the last few years,
these huge climate summits, they've been
really focused on finance and money,
and how that money is distributed
among everyone in the world.
Money is one of the things that's
talked about every year at the Cop,
the International Summit
on Climate Change,
and this year it's going to be held
in the Amazon for the first time,
with a particular focus
on the Amazon.
Are there going to be any agreements
made in order to protect the Amazon?
What can we expect
from this conference?
Yeah, so there's been a lot of talk
of something called the TFFF,
which is the Tropical Forests
Forever facility.
This is a money mechanism basically,
and it's set to launch at Cop30.
It's led by Brazil.
And it basically seeks
to compensate countries
and help them preserve the forest.
But the interesting thing about it is
that 20% of that money will go
to indigenous peoples who,
you know, have a really strong track
record of protecting the forest,
the biodiversity and
the carbon that's stored within it.
But it is worth saying
that more widely this is ten years on
since the biggest climate and most
ambitious actually climate agreement
we've ever had in Paris, which agreed
to sort of ideally keep temperatures
to 1.5 degrees warmer
than pre-industrial times.
That is so important for a place
like the Amazon, as we discussed,
because if we want to protect it, if
we want to reduce the forest fires,
we do need to reduce our emissions.
So that really is on all of us,
isn't it? Graihagh.
